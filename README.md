[Resume/CV (pdf)](https://github.com/darvin/darvin/files/11311613/Resume-Stefan-Novak.6.pdf)

I am an ex-Apple iOS/macOS engineer, with deep hands-on experience of integration of
CoreML, RealityKit, as well as knowledge of Machine Learning approaches and usage of the
on-device ML techniques in the production at scale. During my time at Apple I was focused on
on-device machine learning pipeline development and integration with the Apple-vendored
applications, my recent work at the [STC Research Foundation](https://github.com/STCData) was focused on application of
NLP and vision, conversational AIs to the macOS/iOS apps.
