I am an ex-Apple iOS/macOS engineer, with deep hands-on experience of integration of
CoreML, RealityKit, as well as knowledge of Machine Learning approaches and usage of the
on-device ML techniques in the production at scale. Durin my time at Apple I was focused on
on-device machine learning pipeline development and integration with the Apple-vendored
applications, my recent work at the [STC Research Foundation](https://github.com/STCData) was focused on application of
NLP and vision, [conversational AIs](https://github.com/darvin/ChatGPTDOS) to the macOS/iOS apps.

Besides mentioned I have in-depth exprierience in embedded [Rust](https://github.com/darvin/plato), [Android Jet Pack](https://github.com/darvin/LikeAFly), [flight simulators](https://github.com/darvin/AirSim), game development
